That's a fantastic idea! A well-written README is crucial for presenting your project professionally on GitHub. It acts as the face of your application, explaining what it does, how to use it, and why someone should care.

Here is a comprehensive README file written in Markdown format, which you can copy directly to a file named README.md in your project's root directory.

ðŸ“‹ C++ To-Do List Application (Life Manager Prototype)
Overview
This is a robust, feature-rich Command-Line Interface (CLI) To-Do List and Task Manager built in modern C++ (C++11/14/17). It serves as a prototype for a multi-functional "Life Manager" application, focusing on high reliability, data persistence, and a smooth user experience through careful input validation and organized data handling.

The application allows users to manage daily tasks, prioritize work, set deadlines, and easily filter/search their list, with all data automatically saved to a file between sessions.

âœ¨ Key Features
Data Persistence: All tasks are automatically saved to a local file (todo_data.txt) upon exit and loaded upon startup using standard C++ file I/O (<fstream>), ensuring no data loss.

Advanced Task Management: Tasks include Name, Priority (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, URGENT), Category, and a Due Date.

Flexible Display & Sorting: Users can display the list sorted by Due Date, Priority, Status, Category, or the default unsorted order via a clear menu interface.

Robust Search & Selection: The remove and mark_complete functions allow users to search using a keyword (in name or category) and present a numbered menu for selection, eliminating the risk of acting on the wrong item.

Input Validation: The validate function ensures the program never crashes due to invalid input (e.g., entering letters instead of numbers).

Deadline Alerts: Automatically checks for tasks due within the next 24 hours upon launch.

Summary Statistics: Provides a complete overview of task status, including total count, completion percentage, and breakdown by priority level.

 Technical Design Highlights
Data Structure: Uses std::map<std::string, to_do_item> for core storage. The item name is the key, allowing for fast lookups (O(log n)).

Sorting: To enable sorting by non-key fields (Priority, Due Date), the list is temporarily copied into a std::vector<to_do_item> and sorted using Lambda functions with std::sort.

File I/O (<fstream>): Data is serialized using a pipe (|) delimiter and converted to primitive types (int, time_t) for reliable storage and retrieval. This demonstrates robust file parsing techniques using std::getline and std::stringstream.
